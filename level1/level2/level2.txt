But there is one hidden treasure call Chikhaldara..


It was few years back I got the chance to visit a offbeat tourist place 
not much have been spoken about this place but believe me it’s a place
 worthwhile to see its CHIKALDHARA. It is located in Amaravati district 
of Vidarbha region. The only hill station in the Vidarbha region offers 
you an abundance of wildlife, viewpoints, lakes and waterfalls. 
It’s a place something to do with Indian mythology Place is named after 
"Keechaka". This is the place where Bheema killed villainous Keechaka and threw him into the valley. It thus came to be known as "Keechakadara" - 
"Chikhaldara" is its corruption.
