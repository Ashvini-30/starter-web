it’s a place with abundance beauty hidden treasure of flora and fauna magnificent waterfall and gushing water and a sudden velvet mist around makes the place where Romance bloom.
What’s so good about this, you may ask. There are of course plenty of other mountain resorts elsewhere in Maharashtra. There are two main reasons that makes Chikhaldara unique – very few tourists visit this place, and so, you’ll even now, get all the peace and solitude you want, and second, it’s the only place in the state where you’ll find coffee plantations.
There’s certainly something magical about coffee plantations, the aroma of coffee pumps up Romance in you. If you’ve been to one such place, you’ll know. Coffee trees are low lying. They hug the grown below. But all over, you will find tall trees that make the entire place a green paradise.
